# ToDo






- [ ] Config file to store Author name and anything else we want (so that the default name can be something other than "Henry")
- [ ] Amalgamate_Files needs to read this config file and use its contents to populate the template as needed
- [ ] Lect_Stack.py should be able to use different sorting (decided by the user, e.g. range for numbers, first, last)

- [ ] Have the option to use a custom output file name (-o option)
- [ ] Lots more testing needed
