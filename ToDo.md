# ToDo


- [ ] Script to bundle lecture notes together into a master course file.
- [ ] Script to sort lecture notes by properties like number or date
- [ ] Script to set up a new directory
- [ ] (Maybe) Upload compiled lecture notes to cloud

- [ ] Config file to store Author name and anything else we want (so that the default name can be something other than "Henry")
- [ ] Amalgamate_Files needs to read this config file and use its contents to populate the template as needed

- [ ] Lots more testing needed
